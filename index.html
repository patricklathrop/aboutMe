        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a self-taught web developer who is attending Code Fellows to obtain a formal education in coding and
            development. I am a father, and a husband. I love food and the outdoors, which means in the summer months
            you can find me grilling, hiking, or camping!</p>
        <h2>My Goal</h2>
        <p>My goal as a developer is to help organizations make the web more intuitive and accessible for all users!</p>
        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>I have experience in a variety of labor fields, from warehouse work to construction and the saw mill
            industry. I spent a number of years as a short-order cook, and even spent some time in the military.</p>
        <p>I'm currently attending Code Fellows, as well as pursuing a bachelors degree through Embry-Riddle
            Aeronautical University. I have also completed the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA), which is a
            partner program between Microsoft and the US Army that teaches transitioning Soldiers the core fundamentals
            of server and system administration, as well as Azure cloud support solutions.</p>
